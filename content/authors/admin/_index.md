I am a fourth year Ph.D. candidate majoring in Computer Science at [School of Computer Science & Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology](http://cs.bit.edu.cn/), planning to graduate in the end of August 2021 and looking for opportunities in industarial research positions.

My research interests are mainly focused on Natural language processing (especially Event Extraction and Event Schema Induction) with machine learning approaches.

My Ph.D. supervisor is [professor Heyan Huang](http://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/js/hhy/index.htm).
